## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
flight <- data.frame(CSFI = c(2,5,5,6,6,7,8,9,NA,NA), 
                  TFI = c(1,1,2,3,3,4,5,7,7,8)) #Create the data as a data frame
CSFI <- c(2,5,5,6,6,7,8,9) #Create a vector for CSFI 
TFI <- c(1,1,2,3,3,4,5,7,7,8) #Create a vector for TFI
#This is done to be able to test that the function below can be used with both a data frame
#with missing values as well as with vectors, to ensure optimal usability.
CSFI <- c(2,5,5,6,6,7,8,9) #Create a vector for CSFI 
TFI <- c(1,1,2,3,3,4,5,7,7,8)

##Part 1


MyTtest <- function (x, y) {
  #This function performs a student t-test.
  #Input:
  #The required input are two numeric variables x and y either in the form
  #of columns in a data frame, columns in a matrix or vectors. NAs are omitted
  #Output(as list):
  #   - The mean values of the variables
  #   - The t-statistic values
  #   - The associated p-values
  
  n1 <- length(x[!is.na(x)]) #Define number of observsation in x
  n2 <- length(y[!is.na(y)]) #Define number of observsation in y
  y1 <- mean(x[!is.na(x)]) #Define sample mean of x
  y2 <- mean(y[!is.na(y)]) #Define sample mean of y
  var_x <- var(x[!is.na(x)]) #Define sample variance of x
  var_y <- var(y[!is.na(y)]) #Define sample variance of x
  s <- sqrt(((n1-1)*var_x+(n2-1)*var_y)/
              ((n1-1)+(n2-1))) #Calculate square root of pooled estimate of 
                               #the variance
  df = n1+n2-2 #Define the degrees of freedom
  t_value = (y1-y2)/(s*(sqrt(1/n1+1/n2))) #Calculate the t-value
  p_value = 2*pt(q=t_value, df=df, lower.tail = F) #Calculate the two-sided p-value
  result = list(mean_x = y1, mean_y = y2, t_value = round(t_value,4), df = df, 
                p_value = round(p_value,4)) #Define the output of the function as the means
                                   #of x and y, the t-value, df and two-sided p-value
  return(result) #Return list of results
}


#Compare results of function t.test and MyTtest function above
t.test(flight$CSFI,flight$TFI)

MyTtest(flight$CSFI,flight$TFI)
```
